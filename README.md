# TrustedHumanCertifications [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/duniter/duniter.png)](https://travis-ci.org/duniter/duniter) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/duniter/duniter/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/duniter/duniter?branch=master)

It is a common open source code software and a distributed network to create Peer-to-Peer communities based on trusted human certifications and everyone can generate an Universal Dividend periodically.

It is inspired by the [OpenUDC](https://github.com/Open-UDC/open-udc) project.

## Development state

The software is still under development.

However, it already exists a testing community named [Test_Net](https://forum.duniter.org/t/join-our-new-testnet-currency/813). Do you want to test it ? There are two ways :
