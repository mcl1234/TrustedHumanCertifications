# Duniter [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/duniter/duniter.png)](https://travis-ci.org/duniter/duniter) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/duniter/duniter/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/duniter/duniter?branch=master)

It is a libre software and a distributed network to create Peer-to-Peer communities based on trusted human certifications and everyone can transmit a Universal Dividend periodically.

Inspired by the [OpenUDC](https://github.com/Open-UDC/open-udc) project.

## Development state

The software is still under development.

However, it already exists a testing community named [Test_Net](https://forum.duniter.org/t/join-our-new-testnet-currency/813). Want to test it ? Two ways.

### Add your node to the distributed network

```
$ wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duniter/duniter/master/install.sh | bash
$ duniter init
$ duniter sync duniter.org 8999
$ duniter start
```

and you are done.
