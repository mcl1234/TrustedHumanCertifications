# Duniter [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/duniter/duniter.png)](https://travis-ci.org/duniter/duniter) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/duniter/duniter/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/duniter/duniter?branch=master)

Duniter (previously uCoin) is a libre software allowing to create a new kind of P2P crypto-currencies based on individuals and Universal Dividend.

Inspired by  [OpenUDC](https://github.com/Open-UDC/open-udc) projects.

## Development state

Software is still under development, and **no production currency using Duniter exists for now**.

However, it already exists a testing currency named [Test_Net](https://forum.duniter.org/t/join-our-new-testnet-currency/813). Want to test it? Two ways.

### Add your node to the network

```
$ wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duniter/duniter/master/install.sh | bash
$ duniter init
$ duniter sync duniter.org 8999
$ duniter start
```

and you are done! See [Install documentation](https://github.com/duniter/duniter/wiki/Install-Duniter-node) for further details.

### Try Sakia Wallet

In the world of crypto-currencies, [Sakia Wallet](http://sakia-wallet.org/) would be called a [SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Simplified_Payment_Verification_.28SPV.29_Clients) client. It is a graphical client connecting to the network. See this [tutorial](https://forum.duniter.org/t/join-our-new-testnet-currency/813) to join in the testing currency with Sakia.
